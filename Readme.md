## Open Geospatial Library
The Open Geospatial Library aims to provide an open source GIS library for the .NET framework. The library will implement various Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and ISO specifications. 
Currently, we have ported and enhanced the JTS Topology Suite library, a Java-based open source OGC Feature Geometry implementations, to the .NET framework.

The Open Geospatial Library project also aims to reduce duplication and increase interoperability by providing neutral, interface-only APIs derived from OGC/ISO Standards.
